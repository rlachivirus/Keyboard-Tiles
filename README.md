Have you ever wondered why you couldn’t practice typing while playing piano? Well “Keyboard Tiles” will become your go-to from now on because it is a game where you can practice typing and feel like as if you are playing piano. 

The original game is called “Piano Tiles” and it is an easy game where you have to simply touch the tiles that are descending in different columns. The basic idea is the same but instead of touching, “Keyboard Tiles” will require typing corresponding alphabets that are falling. It is important to type the alphabets in the descending order because each key will make a sound that corresponds to a key in a music.
